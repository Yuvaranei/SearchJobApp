## Search Job App

- On the first page load, lists all the jobs
- Displays the total number of jobs displayed
- User can select the experience or type on location or skill input to search for job
- On Location & skill, user can use enter key to get the results instead of search button also
- User can sort based on job location and experience (Desc / asc / none)
- Used [https://api.myjson.com/bins/kez8a](https://api.myjson.com/bins/kez8a) to fetch data
-Added unit testing to check few metrics

The challenge should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (gitlab.com or bitbucket.com or github are preferred).


##Steps

1. Extract the zip file
2. npm i (to install the dependencies)
3. npm run dev (to run development server) - from localhost:8080, output will be served (if 8080 port occupied, it takes next available port)
4. npm run test (for unit test results for few metrics)
5. open test.html (to view the results as bundled file already available)
